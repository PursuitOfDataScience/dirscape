"""The command line: one pipeline, six views.

Everything here is orchestration. The facts come from `discover`, `quota`,
`state` and the site plugins; the words come from `render`. This module decides
the ORDER, and the order has three constraints that are not obvious and that
each cost a wrong answer if broken:

1. **Quota runs before discovery.** A GPFS per-device quota listing enumerates
   every fileset the user holds blocks in, including ones they have no unix
   group for, and that list is a discovery source no other probe can supply.
   It is the only route to `stranded` storage.
2. **`Snapshot.from_roots` runs before `lineage.append`.** Otherwise "the
   earliest run that saw this root" becomes "this run" and nothing is ever new.
3. **Rendering runs last and reads nothing.** Every value it prints was
   measured by a layer above it, so a field nobody supplied prints `?` rather
   than being filled in at the last moment.

Exit codes, so a script can branch on them:

    0   the run completed and printed a view
    1   bad usage, or an unexpected internal error
    2   a path the user named could not be used
    3   nothing was discovered at all, which on a working cluster means the
        probes were all refused rather than that the storage is empty
